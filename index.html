        <h1> - Clash Royale Lore - </h1>
        <p1>We all know that during medieval and even ancient times, clans co-existed along with kingdoms and they frequently went to fight to each other. Once a clan from the Supercell timeline discovers something overpowered that could create life out of itself - Elixir. As soon as they discovered this liquid, they started creating special pumps that could pump this thing out of the ground.</p1>

        <p1> They discovered that they could make the existing life even stronger with this liquid, so they started building barracks, a place where life would be created out of elixir, the stronger the troop, 
            the more the time and more the elixir. They kept on upgrading the troops, making them stronger and soon an intelligent troop called Wizard helped the clans build laboratories to build spells.</p1>
